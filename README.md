This is a script I wrote for the Thrustmaster SOL-R2 sticks. A special thanks to Gar and AVA for getting me started with their script found on reddit. 
  
It can be found here ----> [Reddit post from garlockgargoyle in r/Thrustmaster](https://www.reddit.com/r/Thrustmaster/comments/1kg0wsn/thrustmaster_solr_led_script_for_newbs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

> [!WARNING]
> My script uses the left stick to initialise the sticks moving the dial to position 21 to set a lighting theme (still need to flesh that out) and then to position 23 where it does a little animation. The script will not accept **ANY** inputs until this is done to simulate an ignition sequence!!

> [!NOTE]
> In order to run this, one **HAS** to hide the sticks completely from SC using:  
> - HidHide v1.5.230  
> - vJoy v2.1.9.1 (the version that works with Win11)  
> - Joystick Gremlin v13.3
>   
> If you don't do this both sticks will be combined into a single interface and will really mess you up!

Run the Thrustmaster script with the T.A.R.G.E.T GUI.  
Enable your JoyStick Gremlin profile (presuming you've mapped it to vJoy).   
Follow instructions on mapping your HOTAS/HOSAS sticks in SC as usual but selecting you vJoy inputs instead. 


🎊 HUZZAH! 🎊 You have fully functional dual stick LEDs! 🔦
